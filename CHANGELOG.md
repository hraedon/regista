# Changelog

All notable changes to substrate are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Plan 007 (Facade decomposition):** Domain-scoped sub-objects (`sub.workflows`, `sub.work_items`, `sub.events`, `sub.claims`, `sub.links`, `sub.hooks`, `sub.recurrence`) via `_ops.py`. Legacy top-level methods remain as thin delegates.
- **Plan 008 (Trust model hardening):**
  - WS-1: `strict_roles=True` flag rejects unregistered actors and `prompt`-source roles at transition time
  - WS-2: Environment-variable key injection via `SUBSTRATE_HMAC_KEY_<KEY_ID>` overrides file secrets
  - WS-3: Vendored `rfc8785` 0.1.4 into `_vendor/` with 73 cross-validation tests against system library
  - WS-5: Raise on unknown key status at startup; `expected_key_count` parameter; `keys_loaded` structured log
- **Plan 009 (Operational runtime):** `MaintenanceThread` in `_maintenance.py` with configurable sweep, recurrence, hook-poll, and partition intervals. `start_maintenance()` / `stop_maintenance()` on `Substrate`. `maintenance_healthy` property. Subsumes hook consumer lifecycle.
- Shared datetime utilities (`_datetime_utils.py`): `ts_equal`, `to_utc`, `ts_equal_within` — eliminated 88 lines of duplication between replay modules.
- CI now installs `[vendor-check]` extra so rfc8785 cross-validation tests run in CI.

### Changed

- Constructor positional-signature contract test (BC-195) pins `Substrate(dsn, project, hmac_key_path)` shape used by sf2.
- BC-196/197/198 (trust model design gaps) accepted and documented; implementation deferred.

### Deprecated

- WS-4 (sidecar rate limiting) explicitly deferred per reviewer consensus.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-21

### Changed

- **RFC-001:** Reverted events table partitioning. Events table is now flat with a global `UNIQUE(event_id)` index. `ensure_event_partitions()` is a no-op returning `[]`. Partition gauges (`events_default_rows`, `events_partition_horizon_days`) removed from Prometheus metrics. Migrations renumbered 010–013 (gaps 010/014 closed; no production data affected).
- **BC-194:** Heartbeat coalescing — `heartbeat_claim` suppresses `claim_heartbeat` events within `max(60s, ttl/2)` threshold. New optional `coalesce_threshold` parameter for custom override. Replay drift detection tolerates `claim_expires_at` deltas within the coalesce threshold.

### Deprecated

- `ensure_event_partitions()` — no-op, will be removed in a future version
- `auto_partition` parameter on `Substrate.create_project()` — no-op, will be removed in a future version
- Prometheus gauges `substrate_events_default_rows` and `substrate_events_partition_horizon_days` — no longer emitted

### Fixed

- `_ts_equal_within` in replay modules incorrectly called `.astimezone(UTC)` on naive datetimes (assumed local time instead of UTC)
- `_ts_equal` mixed naive/aware comparison logic simplified to normalize both to UTC

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added

- Event-sourced coordination library for agent pipelines over Postgres (FR-01 through FR-29)
- Schema-per-project isolation with `SET LOCAL search_path` scoping
- Immutable append-only event log with gap-free `event_seq` per work-item
- Transactionally-consistent denormalized projection (`work_items_current`)
- HMAC-SHA256 signing with RFC 8785 canonicalization; library is sole signer (FR-15)
- Monthly partitioned events table (migration 010) — **removed in RFC-001**; events table is now flat with global `UNIQUE(event_id)`
- Durable claims with TTL, attempt tracking, and auto-steal on expiry
- Workflow registry with content-hash idempotency
- Sync transition validators with 5s timeout and I/O safety AST check (FR-13)
- Async hook queue with dead-letter, retry, and out-of-process claim/complete/fail lifecycle
- Actor role enforcement (FR-24) with `register_actor_role` / `check_actor_role_authorized`
- Custom field validation at workflow registration and transition time (FR-27)
- Typed directed links between work items
- Cursor-based pagination on `query_work_items`
- JSONB containment (`@>`) filtering on custom fields with GIN index (BC-139)
- Replay with drift detection and continue-on-revoked flag (FR-25)
- `update_not_before` API for rescheduling work items (FR-26)
- Recurring work items with interval and RRULE schedules, catch-up policies (FR-28)
- Workflow composition via `extends:` with keyed list merge and `__append`/`__remove` modifiers (FR-29)
- Admin CLI: `workflow validate`, `work-item show/list`, `events show/tail`, `replay`, `schema init/status`, `hooks dead-letter list/requeue`, `actor-roles list`, `recurrence list/due/fire/cancel/update`
- HTTP sidecar (Plan 005): thin 1:1 pass-through of the Python API over FastAPI with bearer-token auth, sole-signer enforcement, hook claim/complete/fail lifecycle, and OpenAPI docs
- Dockerfile and README for sidecar deployment (`deploy/sidecar/`)
- Prometheus metrics via `prometheus_client.CollectorRegistry`
- Structured logging via structlog
- CI configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- In-memory backend for testing (`InMemorySubstrate`)
- Single-source-of-truth backend contract via `_contract.py` (RFC-062)
- Property-based conformance tests via hypothesis

### Fixed

- 188 breadcrumbs resolved across security, correctness, and conformance dimensions
- Key fixes: claim zombie revival prevention (BC-071), cross-partition event_id uniqueness (BC-148), projection-before-event ordering (BC-147), validator ThreadPoolExecutor lock leak (BC-146), structlog stderr routing in CLI
